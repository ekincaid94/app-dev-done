UX/DX approach adopted:
For this project I closely followed the placemark labs aiming to just improve my assignment 1 submission.

Git approach:
For this assignment I used tagged releases to allow me to easily track my changes and developments.

Personal Statement:
I found this module particularly difficult and found simple mistakes costing me a few days at a time.
While the labs themselves seemed very straightforward to follow, it was simple errors that I struggled to get around such as my current login issue.
I was under time pressure this year and would probably have been better off to defer my place in the course.
